Here are the steps when you are going to add a new page, and the requirements for it:

1) Create the class
    Go into the page-classes folder, and create a new design form class.  This is the one
    that has the .cpp, .h, and .ui all tied together.  Make sure you are extending QWidget,
    and not QMainWindow.  You are going to want to give your class some descriptive name
    that makes it obvious what that page is for.

2) Get the class ready
    First: Go into the .ui file, and add at least these two buttons
      (Class QPushButton) named "prevButton", and "nextButton".  Generally we are placing those
      in the bottom corners of the page.  Then, set the width of the page to 1000, and the height
      to 600.  Also change the minWidth and minHeight to the same values or it won't work right.
    Second: Go into the .h file and add two methods:
      void getPrevButton();
      void getNextButton();
    Third: Go into your .cpp file and implement these two methods.  They should return pointers
      to your prevButton and nextButton, respectively.  See an existing page-class for an
      example.

3) Add method to screenhandler.h
    You'll see in screenhandler.h that there are methods called things like setup[PageNameHere]();
    Add your own that lines up with the name of your class/page.

4) Add method to screenhandler.cpp
    Go into screenhandler.cpp.  Copy the ScreenHandler::setupWelcomePage method (the entire thing).
    Paste it below all the other setup methods, and rename it to the name you gave the method in the
    .h file.  Then, go up to the top of the .h file and add an #include statement to the .h file you
    created.  Then, on the first line in the method you copy-pasted, where the page gets instantiated.
    Change the class name (both occurances on the line) to your class name.

5) Call method in screenhandler.cpp constructor
    You'll see a set of method calls to the setup methods.  Add yours in here.  Keep in mind: the
    order they are instantiated is the same order they will appear in as you go through the program.


And that's it!  As you run the program, you will see your page pop up after the previous last one.
